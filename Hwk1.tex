\begin{prob}
Let's consider a simple game. Jack and Jill alternate taking turns, rolling a single die. The first one to reach a total of at least $d$ dots wins, with the prize being \$d dollars. Jill rolls first.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find P(Jill wins).
    \item Find P(Jill wins, taking 2 turns to do so).
    \item Find the probability that the difference between the winner's and loser's totals is equal to 1.
    \item The 10 O'Clock News reports that Jill won, but doesn't say what her prize was. Find the probability that her prize was \$6.
    \item Write a function with call form \\ 
    simjj(d,nreps) \\ 
    that will simulate nreps repetitions of the game, for general values of d. The return value will be an R list, with components winner, prize and loserDots, each of which is a vector of length nreps, showing winners, winners' prize money and losers' number of dots. (E.g. if Jack wins and Jill has accumulated 3 dots by then, then loserDots is 3.)
\end{enumerate}
